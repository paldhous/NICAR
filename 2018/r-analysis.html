Described on its website as “free software environment for statistical computing and graphics,” R is a programming language that opens a world of possibilities for analyzing data. Indeed, just about anything you may want to do with data can be done with R, from web scraping, through statistical analysis and machine learning, to making interactive graphics.</p><p>There is much more material here than we will be able to cover in a short class, but these notes will remain available for you to work through later.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a></strong> is an “integrated development environment,” or IDE, for R that provides a user-friendly interface.</p><p>Launch RStudio, and the screen should look like this:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The main panel to the left is the R Console. Type valid R code into here, hit <code>return</code>, and it will be run.</p><h3 id="the-data-we-will-use"><a name="the-data-we-will-use" href="#the-data-we-will-use"></a>The data we will use</h3><p>The data for this session should be loaded on the computers at NICAR. If you’re following along remotely or on your own computer at the meeting, download from <a href="data/r-analysis.zip">here</a>, unzip the folder and place it on your desktop. It contains the following files:</p><ul>
<li><p><code>ca_discipline.csv</code> Disciplinary alerts and actions issued by the Medical Board of California from 2008 to 2017. Processed from downloads available <a href="http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Publications/Disciplinary_Actions/">here</a>. Contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alert_date</code> Date alert issued.</li><li><code>last_name</code> Last name of doctor/health care provider.</li><li><code>first_name</code> First name of doctor/health care provider.</li><li><code>middle_name</code> Middle/other names.</li><li><code>name_suffix</code> Name suffix (Jr., II etc)</li><li><code>city</code> City of practive location.</li><li><code>state</code> State of practice location.</li><li><code>license</code> California medical license number.</li><li><code>action_type</code> Type of action.</li><li><code>action_date</code> Date of action.</li></ul>
</li></ul><ul>
<li><p><code>ca_medicare_opioids.csv</code> Data on prescriptions of opioid drugs under the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program by doctors in California, from 2013 to 2015. Filtered from the national data downloads available <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Part-D-Prescriber.html">here</a>. It contains many variables, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npi</code> <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/">National Provider Identifier</a> (NPI) for the doctor/organization making the claim. This is a unique code for each health care provider.</li><li><code>nppes_provider_last_org_name</code> For individual doctors, their last name. For organizations, the organziation name.</li><li><code>nppes_provider_first_name</code> First name for individual doctors, blank for organizations.</li><li><code>nppes_provider_city</code> City where the provider is located.</li><li><code>nppes_provider_state</code> State where the provider is located; “CA” for all of these records.</li><li><code>specialty_description</code> Provider’s medical speciality, reported on their medicare claims. For providers that have more than one Medicare specialty code reported on their claims, the code associated with the largest number of services.</li><li><code>drug_name</code> Includes both brand names (drugs that have a trademarked name) and generic names (drugs that do not have a trademarked name).</li><li><code>generic_name</code> The chemical ingredient of a drug rather than the trademarked brand name under which the drug is sold.</li><li><code>bene_count</code> Total number of unique Medicare Part D beneficiaries (i.e. patients) with at least one claim for the drug. Counts fewer than 11 are suppressed and are indicated by a blank.</li><li><code>total_claim_count</code> Number of Medicare Part D claims; includes original prescriptions and refills. If less than 11, counts are not included in the data file.</li><li><code>total_drug_cost</code> Total cost paid for all associated claims; includes ingredient cost, dispensing fee, sales tax, and any applicable fees.</li><li><code>year</code> 2013, 2014, or 2015.</li></ul>
</li><li><p><code>npi_license.csv</code> Crosswalk file to join NPI identifiers to state license numbers, processed from the download available <a href="http://www.nber.org/data/npi-state-license-crosswalk.html">here</a> to include license numbers potentially matching California doctors. This will provide one way of joining the precription data to the medical board disciplinary data. As we shall see, problems with the data mean that it is not infallible. Contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npi</code> National Provider Identifier, as described above.</li><li><code>plicnum</code> State license number, from the original file.</li><li><code>license</code> Processed from <code>pclicnum</code> to conform to the format of California medical license numbers.</li></ul>

Although <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/2-old-painkiller-papers">widespread medical prescription</a> of opioids <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/whats-causing-the-opioid-crisis">helped drive addiction</a>, a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/life-expectancy-opioid-overdoses">majority of overdoses</a> now occur through the consumption of drugs purchased illegally.</p><p>Opioids have important medical uses, and just because a doctor prescribes large amounts of the drugs doesn’t necessarily mean they are practising irresponsibly.</p><p>As ProPublica explained, in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-medicares-drug-data-long-methodology">the methods</a> for its stories based on Medicare Part D prescription data:</p><blockquote>
<p>The data could not tell us everything. We interviewed many high-volume prescribers to better understand their patients and their practices. Some told us their numbers were high because they were credited with prescriptions by others working in the same practice. In addition, providers who primarily work in long-term care facilities or busy clinics with many patients naturally may write more prescriptions.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="reproducibility:-save-your-scripts"><a name="reproducibility:-save-your-scripts" href="#reproducibility:-save-your-scripts"></a>Reproducibility: Save your scripts</h3><p>Data journalism should ideally be fully documented and reproducible. R makes this easy, as every operation performed can be saved in a script, and repeated by running that script. Click on the <img src="img/r-analysis_2.jpg" alt=""> icon at top left and select <code>R Script</code>. A new panel should now open:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_3.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Any code we type in here can be run in the console. Hitting <code>Run</code> will run the line of code on which the cursor is sitting. To run multiple lines of code, highlight them and click <code>Run</code>.</p><p>Click on the save/disk icon in the script panel and save the blank script to the file on your desktop with the data for this week, calling it <code>r-analysis.R</code>.</p><h3 id="set-your-working-directory"><a name="set-your-working-directory" href="#set-your-working-directory"></a>Set your working directory</h3><p>Now we can set the working directory to this folder by selecting from the top menu <code>Session&gt;Set Working Directory&gt;To Source File Location</code>. (Doing so means we can load the files in this directory without having to refer to the full path for their location, and anything we save will be written to this folder.)</p><p>Notice how this code appears in the console (the exact code will depend upon the location of the script and data on your computer:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;>setwd(&quot;~/Desktop/r-analysis&quot;)
</code></pre>">setwd(<span class="hljs-string">"~/Desktop/r-analysis"</span>)
</code></pre><h3 id="save-your-data"><a name="save-your-data" href="#save-your-data"></a>Save your data</h3><p>The panel at top right has three tabs, the first showing the <code>Environment</code>, or all of the “objects” loaded into memory for this R session. Save this as well, and you won’t have to load and process all of the data again if you return to return to a project later.</p><p>Click on the save/disk icon in the <code>Environment</code> panel to save the file as <code>week5.RData</code>. The following code should appear in the Console:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;>save.image(&quot;~/Desktop/r-analysis/r-analysis.RData&quot;)
</code></pre>">save.image(<span class="hljs-string">"~/Desktop/r-analysis/r-analysis.RData"</span>)
</code></pre><p>Copy this code into your script, placing it at the end, with a comment, explaining what it does:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># save session data

</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># save session data</span>
save.image(<span class="hljs-string">"~/Desktop/r-analysis/r-analysis.RData"</span>)
</code></pre><p>Now if you run your entire script, the last action will always be to save the data in your environment.</p><h3 id="comment-your-code"><a name="comment-your-code" href="#comment-your-code"></a>Comment your code</h3><p>Anything that appears on a line after <code>#</code> will be treated as a comment, and will be ignored when the code is run. You can use this to explain what the code does. Get into the habit of commenting your code: Don’t trust yourself to remember!</p><h3 id="some-r-code-basics"><a name="some-r-code-basics" href="#some-r-code-basics"></a>Some R code basics</h3><ul>
<li><code>&lt;-</code> is known as an “assignment operator.” It means: “Make the object named to the left equal to the output of the code to the right.”</li><li><code>&amp;</code> means AND, in Boolean logic.</li><li><code>|</code> means OR, in Boolean logic.</li><li><code>!</code> means NOT, in Boolean logic.</li><li>When referring to values entered as text, or to dates, put them in quote marks, like this: <code>"United States"</code>, or <code>"2016-07-26"</code>. Numbers are not quoted.</li><li>When entering two or more values as a list, combine them using the function <code>c</code>, for combine, with the values separated by commas, for example: <code>c("2017-07-26","2017-08-04")</code></li><li>As in a spreadsheet, you can specify a range of values with a colon, for example: <code>c(1:10)</code> creates a list of integers (whole numbers) from one to ten.</li><li><p>Some common operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> <code>-</code> add, subtract.</li><li><code>*</code> <code>/</code> multiply, divide.</li><li><code>&gt;</code> <code>&lt;</code> greater than, less than.</li><li><code>&gt;=</code> <code>&lt;=</code> greater than or equal to, less than or equal to.</li><li><code>!=</code> not equal to.</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Equals signs can be a little confusing, but see how they are used in the code we use today:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> test whether an object is equal to a value. This is often used when filtering data, as we will see.</li><li><code>=</code> make an object equal to a value; similar to <code>&lt;-</code>, but used within a function (see below).</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Handling null values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nulls are designated as <code>NA</code>.</li><li><code>is.na(x)</code> looks for nulls within variable <code>x</code>.</li><li><code>!is.na(x)</code> looks for non-null values within variable <code>x</code>.</li></ul>
</li></ul><p>Here, <code>is.na</code> is a <strong>function</strong>. Functions are followed by parentheses, and act on the data/code in the parentheses.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Object and variable names in R should not contain spaces.</p><h3 id="introducing-r-packages-and-the-tidyverse"><a name="introducing-r-packages-and-the-tidyverse" href="#introducing-r-packages-and-the-tidyverse"></a>Introducing R packages and the tidyverse</h3><p>Much of the power of R comes from the thousands of “packages” written by its community of open source contributors. These are optimized for specific statistical, graphical or data-processing tasks. To see what packages are available in the basic distribution of R, select the <code>Packages</code> tab in the panel at bottom right. To find packages for particular tasks, try searching Google using appropriate keywords and the phrase “R package.”</p><p>Our goal for today’s class is to get used to processing and analyzing data using a powerful series of R packages known as the  <strong><a href="https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/">tidyverse</a></strong>.</p><p>The tidyverse was pioneered by <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, chief scientist at RStudio, but now has many contributors.</p><p>Today, we will use the following tidyverse packages:</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://readr.tidyverse.org/">readr</a></strong> Reads and writes CSV and other text files.</li><li><strong><a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a></strong> Processes and analyzes data, using the operations we discussed in the first class.</li><li><strong><a href="http://lubridate.tidyverse.org/">lubridate</a></strong> Makes working with dates and times much easier.</li><li><strong><a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a></strong> For making charts.</li></ul><p>The tidyverse packages should already be installed on the computers at NICAR.</p><p>To install a package, click on the <code>Install</code> icon in the <code>Packages</code> tab, type its name into the dialog box, and make sure that <code>Install dependencies</code> is checked, as some packages will only run correctly if other packages are also installed.  The tidyverse packages can be installed in one go. Click <code>Install</code> and all of the required packages should install:</p><p><img src="img/r-analyisis_4.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Notice that the following code appears in the console:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
</code></pre>">install.packages(<span class="hljs-string">"tidyverse"</span>)
</code></pre><p>So you can also install packages with code in this format, without using the point-and-click interface.</p><p>Each time you start R, it’s a good idea to click on <code>Update</code> in the <code>Packages</code> panel to update all your installed packages to the latest versions.</p><p>Installing a package makes it available to you, but to use it in any R session you need to load it. You can do this by checking its box in the <code>Packages</code> panel. However, we will enter the following code into our script, then highlight these lines of code and run them:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># load packages to read and write csv files, process data, and work with dates
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># load packages to read and write csv files, process data, and work with dates</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">library</span>(readr)
<span class="hljs-keyword">library</span>(dplyr)
<span class="hljs-keyword">library</span>(lubridate)
</code></pre><p>At this point, and at regular intervals, save your script, by clicking the save/disk icon in the script panel, or using the <code>⌘-S</code>/<code>Ctrl-S</code> keyboard shortcut.</p><h3 id="load-and-view-data"><a name="load-and-view-data" href="#load-and-view-data"></a>Load and view data</h3><h4 id="load-data"><a name="load-data" href="#load-data"></a>Load data</h4><p>You can load data into the current R session by selecting <code>Import Dataset&gt;From Text File...</code> in the <code>Environment</code> tab.</p><p>However, we will use the <code>read_csv</code> function from the <strong>readr</strong> package. Copy the following code into your script and <code>Run</code>:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># load ca medical board disciplinary actions data
ca_discipline &amp;lt;- read_csv(&quot;ca_discipline.csv&quot;)
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># load ca medical board disciplinary actions data</span>
ca_discipline &lt;- read_csv(<span class="hljs-string">"ca_discipline.csv"</span>)
</code></pre><p>Notice that the <code>Environment</code> now contains an objects of the type <code>tbl_df</code>, a variety of the standard R object for holding tables of data, known as a <strong>data frame</strong>:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_5.jpg" alt=""></p><h4 id="examine-the-data"><a name="examine-the-data" href="#examine-the-data"></a>Examine the data</h4><p>We can <code>View</code> data at any time by clicking on its table icon in the <code>Environment</code> tab in the <code>Grid</code> view. The following code has the same effect:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;>View(ca_discipline)
</code></pre>">View(ca_discipline)
</code></pre><p>The <code>glimpse</code> function from <strong>dplyr</strong> will tell you more about the variables in your data, including their data type. Copy this code into your script and <code>Run</code>:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="r" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;r&quot;># view structure of data
glimpse(ca_discipline)
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># view structure of data</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="process-and-analyze-data-with-dplyr"><a name="process-and-analyze-data-with-dplyr" href="#process-and-analyze-data-with-dplyr"></a>Process and analyze data with dplyr</h3><p>We can use <strong>dplyr</strong> to process the data, using these basic operations with data:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Sort:</strong> Largest to smallest, oldest to newest, alphabetical etc.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Filter:</strong> Select a defined subset of the data.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Summarize/Aggregate:</strong> Deriving one value from a series of other values to produce a summary statistic. Examples include: count, sum, mean, median, maximum, minimum etc. Often you’ll <strong>group</strong> data into categories first, and then aggregate by group.</p>
</li><li><p><strong>Join:</strong> Merging entries from two or more datasets based on common field(s), e.g. unique ID number, last name and first name.</p>
</li></ul><p>Here are some of the most useful functions in <strong>dplyr</strong>:</p><ul>
<li><code>select</code> Choose which columns to include.</li><li><code>filter</code> <strong>Filter</strong> the data.</li><li><code>arrange</code> <strong>Sort</strong> the data, by size for continuous variables, by date, or alphabetically.</li><li><code>group_by</code> <strong>Group</strong> the data by a categorical variable.</li><li><code>summarize</code> <strong>Summarize</strong>, or aggregate (for each group if following <code>group_by</code>). Often used in conjunction with functions including:<ul>
<li><code>mean(x)</code> Calculate the mean, or average, for variable <code>x</code>.</li><li><code>median(x)</code> Calculate the median.</li><li><code>max(x)</code> Find the maximum value.</li><li><code>min(x)</code> Find the minimum value.</li><li><code>sum(x)</code> Add all the values together.</li><li><code>n()</code> Count the number of records. Here there isn’t a variable in the brackets of the function, because the number of records applies to all variables.</li><li><code>n_distinct(x</code>) Count the number of unique values in variable <code>x</code>.</li></ul>
</li><li><code>mutate</code> Create new column(s) in the data, or change existing column(s).</li><li><code>rename</code> Rename column(s).</li><li><code>bind_rows</code> Merge two data frames into one, combining data from columns with the same name.</li></ul><p>There are also various functions to <strong>join</strong> data, which we will explore later.</p><p>These functions can be chained together using the “pipe” operator <code>%&gt;%</code>, which makes the output of one line of code the input for the next. This allows you to run through a series of operations in a logical order. I find it helpful to think of <code>%&gt;%</code> as meaning “then.”</p><p>Now we will use <strong>dplyr</strong> to turn the <code>alert_date</code> variable back to dates:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># convert alert_date to date using dplyr
ca_discipline &amp;lt;- ca_discipline %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(alert_date = as.Date(alert_date))
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># convert alert_date to date using dplyr</span>
ca_discipline &lt;- ca_discipline %&gt;%
  mutate(alert_date = as.Date(alert_date))
</code></pre><p>This code copies the <code>ca_discipline</code> data frame, and then (<code>%&gt;%</code>) uses <strong>dplyr</strong>‘s <code>mutate</code> function to change the data type for the <code>alert_date</code> variable. Because the copied data frame has the same name, it overwrites the original version.</p><h4 id="filter-and-sort-data"><a name="filter-and-sort-data" href="#filter-and-sort-data"></a>Filter and sort data</h4><p>To get used to working with <strong>dplyr</strong>, we will now start filtering and sorting the data according to the doctors’ locations, and the types of disciplinary actions they faced.</p><p>First, let’s look at the types of disciplinary actions in the data:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># look at types of disciplinary actions
types &amp;lt;- ca_discipline %&amp;gt;%
  select(action_type) %&amp;gt;%
  unique()
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># look at types of disciplinary actions</span>
types &lt;- ca_discipline %&gt;%
  select(action_type) %&gt;%
  unique()
</code></pre><p>This code first copies the <code>ca_disciplinary</code> data frame into a new object called <code>types</code>. Then (<code>%&gt;%</code>) it <code>select</code>s the <code>action_type</code> variable only. Finally, it uses a function called <code>unique</code> to display the unique values in that variable, with no duplicates.</p><p>The new data frame has one column and 75 rows. If you <code>View</code>, the first few rows should look like this:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_6.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Many of the values for <code>action_types</code> seem to be subtle variations of the same thing. If we were going to all analyze the types in detail, we may need to group some of these together, after speaking to an expert to understand what they all mean. But some of the action types are clear and unambiguous: <code>Revoked</code> is the medical board’s most severe sanction, which cancels a doctor’s license to practise. So let’s first <strong>filter</strong> the data to look at those actions:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># filter for license revocations only
revoked &amp;lt;- ca_discipline %&amp;gt;%
  filter(action_type == &quot;Revoked&quot;)
</code></pre>"><span class="hljs-comment"># filter for license revocations only</span>
revoked &lt;- ca_discipline %&gt;%
  filter(action_type == <span class="hljs-string">"Revoked"</span>)
</code></pre><p>This code copies the <code>ca_discipline</code> data into a new data frame called <code>revoked</code> and then (<code>%&gt;%</code>) uses the <code>filter</code> function to include only actions in which a doctor’s license was revoked. Notice the use of <code>==</code> to test whether <code>action_type</code> is <code>Revoked</code>.</p><p>There should be 446 rows in the filtered data, and the first few should look like this:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_7.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Some of the doctors are not actually based in California. Doctors can be licensed to practise in more than one state, and the Medical Board of California typically issues its own sanction if a doctor is disciplined in their home state. So let’s now <strong>filter</strong> the data to look only at doctors with revoked licenses who were based in California, and <strong>sort</strong> them by city.</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># filter for license revocations by doctors based in California, and sort by city

         &amp; state == <span class="hljs-string">"CA"</span>) %&gt;%
  arrange(city)
</code></pre><p>Here, the <code>filter</code> combines two conditions with <code>&amp;</code>. That means that both have to be met for the data to be included. Then <code>arrange</code> <strong>sorts</strong> the data, which for a text variable will be in alphabetical order. If you wanted to sort in reverse alphabetical order, the code would be: <code>(arrange(desc(city))</code>.</p><p>There should be 274 rows in the filtered data, and the first few should look like this:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_8.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now let’s <strong>filter</strong> for doctors based in Berkeley or Oakland who have had their licenses revoked:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># doctors in Berkeley or Oakland who have had their licenses revoked

  mutate(year = year(action_date),
         month = month(action_date))
</code></pre><p>Now we have two extra columns in the data, giving the year and the month as a number:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_10.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The <code>year</code> and <code>month</code> functions are from the <strong>lubridate</strong> package. </p><p>Previously we used the <strong>dplyr</strong> <code>mutate</code> function to modify an existing variable. Here we used it to create new variables. You can create or modify multiple variables in the same <code>mutate</code> function, separating each one by commas. Notice the use of <code>=</code> to make a variable equal to the output of code, within the <code>mutate</code> function.</p><p>Now we can calculate the number of license revocations for doctors based in California by year:</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># license revokations for doctors based in California, by year

  group_by(year) %&gt;%
  summarize(revocations = n())
</code></pre><p>This should be the result:</p><p><img src="img/r-analysis_11.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The code first <strong>filters</strong> the data, as before, then <strong>groups</strong> by the new variable <code>year</code> using <code>group_by</code>, then <strong>summarizes</strong> by counting the number of records for each year using <code>summarize</code>.

So if we want to count the number of license revocations by month over all the years, we should first <strong>filter</strong> out the data for 2008, which will otherwise skew the result.</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;># license revokations for doctors based in California, by month

Particularly useful are histograms, to examine a distribution, and scatterplots, to see how one variable varies with another.</p><p>To make simple charts, we will use <strong>ggplot2</strong>.</p><h4 id="introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics"><a name="introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics" href="#introducing-ggplot2-and-the-grammar-of-graphics"></a>Introducing ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics</h4><p>The “gg” in <strong>ggplot2</strong> stands for “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448">grammar of graphics</a>,” an approach to drawing charts devised by the statistician Leland Wilkinson. Rather than thinking in terms of finished charts like a scatter plot or a column chart, it starts by defining the coordinate system (usually the X and Y axes), maps data onto those coordinates, and then adds layers such as points, bars and so on. This is the logic behind ggplot2 code.</p><p>Some key things to understand about <strong>ggplot2</strong>:</p><ul>
<li><code>ggplot</code> This is the master function that creates a <strong>ggplot2</strong> chart.</li><li><code>aes</code> This function, named for “aesthetic mapping,” is used whenever data values are mapped onto a chart. So it is used when you define which variables are plotted onto the X and Y axes, and also if you want to change the size or color of parts of the chart according to values for a variable.</li><li><code>geom</code> All of the functions that add layers to a chart start with <code>geom</code>, followed by an underscore, for example <code>geom_point</code> or <code>geom_bar</code>. The code in the parentheses for any <code>geom</code> layer styles the items in that layer, and can include <code>aes</code> mappings of values from data.</li><li><code>theme</code> This function modifies the appearance of elements of a plot, used, for example, to set size and font face for text, the position of a legend, and so on.</li><li><code>scale</code> Functions that begin with <code>scale</code>, followed by an underscore, are used to modify the way an <code>aes</code> mapping of data appears on a chart. They can change the axis range, for example, or specify a color palette to be used to encode values in the data.</li><li><code>+</code> is used each time you add a layer, a scale, a theme, or elements like axis labels and a title. After a <code>+</code> you can continue on the same line of code or move the next line. I usually write a new line after each <code>+</code>, which makes the code easier to follow.</li></ul><h4 id="make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data"><a name="make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data" href="#make-a-histogram-of-the-prescriptions-data"></a>Make a histogram of the prescriptions data</h4><p>First load <strong>ggplot2</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/scales.pdf">scales</a></strong> package, which allows numbers to be displayed as currency, with thousands separated by commas, and so on.</p><pre class="r hljs"><code class="R" data-origin="<pre><code class=&quot;R&quot;>library(ggplot2)
